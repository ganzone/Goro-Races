# Goro Races
## A clone of "Power Racer" from GameBoy :)

This is a 3D project I realized during my last year of University.\
It's a clone of "Power Racer", an old game for Game Boy which I loved.

ARROWS - Change track\
SHIFT  - Accelerate\
F2     - New Game

Written in C++ using SDL and OpenGL.

Enjoy !
